A simplistic representation of an ecosystem where dots will either die or reproduce depending on their neighbours.

## N Queen Problem
The 8 queen problem is to place 8 queens on a chess board such that none can take/move to any other queen on the board. The N queen problem is a generalized version of that problem where you attempt to place N queens on an N by N chess Board. This solution uses evolutionary computing methods as opposed to a direct solution.
